* So to start off in HTML to tell the hoster (the computer that shows our website to a domain name ourdomain.xyz or google.com is a domain)

* We are also going to use stars to show off comments instead of doing triditional comments. Theese will still show in the website
*so dont do it! This is just a example!

*So lets go step by step! There will be a number (again don't do this this is only to show what step was done) and that will correspond to *the steps!  

*Step 1 - First we will add theese <> they are called "tags" theese are what makes up over 50% of HTML so to tell the Hoster that we are
*Using HTML we are gonna start off with the <html> </html> tags if there is a </> in one that means its ending one that already exist!

*Step 2 - So now we are going to setup this page like a third grade document! So we do our headers by doing <Header> and </Header>
* This is where stuff like our title and header text will go!

*Step 3 - So now we are adding our title this is what you see on the tab this is the text that goes here. I know it looks scary but once *you put just a little bit of thought into it, It will be completly normal and you may get used to it!

*Step 4 - So now we are going to do the same things that we did with the title but now we are going to do it with a new line! And Now we *are going to put <H1></H1> H1 Stands for Header text 1 which is the largest font it goes up to Nine! Nine is the smallest you can go! 

*Step 5 - So now we are going to create another tab called <Body></Body> theese are the same as the header except there farther down
* Do you remember how I said that we are going to structure this like a Third Grade document? Well thats what we are doing now!
* Screw it at this point lets make the footer while we are at it. You do that by making another "tab" with <Footer> and </footer>

*Step 6 - So now we are going to use the <BR> tag  between the </header> tag and the <body> tag to represent a diffrent area!  
*Just note for this one we really don't need to add </br> we can but it would just be a waste of time y'know

*Step 7 - So now we are going to style the <body> tab like we did with the header except without the <title> tag since we only need to do *this once doing it more than one time would just be a waste of time since it wouldn't even change.

 *Step 8 - So now we are going to "Design" the footer "tab" like we did with the <body> tag Note this is usually where websites will be *like "Copyright 2022, Company no one asked for us but we are here"
    
 *Step 9 - Finding a hoster to be honest I reccomend https://app.infinityfree.net/register also called "Infinityfree" this Hoster is *forever free unless you upgrade plans and your domain doesn't get falsely taken down for abusing infinityfrees server as you can see im *still very salty about that + it includes php support and you can run php on infinityfree servers. Now if you don't wanna use *infinityfree you can use profreehost which is also forever free unless you do something stupid and spend three hours trying to upload *something on to there pre historic area aged hosting pcs (yes im still salty about that) all good hosters come with there own down sides *but this comes with the exception of no php support. 
    
 *Step 10 - The most important rules when messing with ANY type of code. Most likely no code is going to work the first time it will take *time and time to perfect your code. - all of this code is up for free at

* All of our code goes under here :D
2 <header>
    
   3 <title>Hello World!</title>
   4 <H1> Hello World! </H1>

  7  <H4> This is the body "tab" </H4>
    
7. So i can type anything here since there is no real <text> tag and it will show up same reason why the Comment system <br>
